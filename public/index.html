    <!-- Issue One -->
    <!-- 3 script tags is not ideal. Good for a simple example  -->
    <!-- but if you plan to deploy your app to production working with react -->
    <!-- its going to be best to manage your 3rd party dependencies using npm -->
    <!-- right now we're making 4 separate requests -->

    <!-- Issue Two -->
    <!-- right now, inside app.jsx we use jsx code and some ES6 features -->
    <!-- which aren't available in the browser by default -->
    <!-- the problem is we convert this code into JavaScript live inside the browser -->
    <!-- which can be time consuming and expensive -->
    <!-- Ideally, we'd have all of this code converted before we ever start the server -->
    <!-- When the server gets started and Express is listening for users of the app - it's ready -->
